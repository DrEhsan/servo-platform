* cd server && 
 node app.js
* cd editor &&
 gulp serve

## **Database:**

### couchbase
 * install couchbase
 * restore from release-proc/couchbase-buckets
 * change db entry at src/server/config.json to 'couchdb'
### mongodb
* install mongodb
 * change db entry at src/server/config.json to 'mongo'


## **Certificates:**
 
1. get a new domain 

2. Install a certificate

* all certificates should be put under a server/certificates/<domain> folder, with following names:
**cert.pem
**chain.pem
**privkey.pem

* change entries at server/config.json:
``"serverBaseDomain": "<domain>",
  "openSSL": true,
``  

## E2E/Unit tests:
